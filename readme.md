<p>This chart shows 1304 black deaths and 2500 white deaths from police shootings since 2015. If this was the argument to claim that white deaths happen a lot more than black, then perhaps the argument for police brutality is an important discussion that needs to happen right?</p>
<p>But lets try looking at the information from another perspective. Lets look at the amount of people for each race</p>

<table border="1">
